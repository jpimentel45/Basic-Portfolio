        As you may have noticed, my name is Juan Alberto Pimentel JR. I am 24 years old, I am 6'2, and despite my skin color, I am 100% Mexican, not white/mixed.

             I have been attending PCC for 4 years. I was originally majoring in Nursing. I completed all my general ed courses, as well as the classes required to apply to the Nursing progam. I am currently studying for my TEA's exam, so I could apply to Nursing school. While I improve my knowledge in Nursing, I thought it would be great to enroll in UCLA's coding bootcamp. So far the class seems stressfull, but at the same time I am enjoying the class content.
